His first known home was with a Swiss guy, Olaf Breuning. His second human, Barb Choit, has Canadian/American citizenship.  He&#39;s an orange tabby (like Garfield or Heathcliff).  He has a biting problem because he gets over-excited when people like him. He drools when over-relaxed.  Most of our friends are a little afraid of him. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergeant (SMMS) has been staying with foster parents Merkx &amp; Gwynne (Typaldos is allergic) and since his artist catma packed up her Brooklyn apartment for good, he is now officially an orphan ...again.  We thought we’d do something crazy and confusing to celebrate his newfound independence, so for one week SMMS will stay in a specially designed enclosure that we’ve built just for him.  Since we came up with the idea when we were in Switzerland, as art-workers, everything on the interior is built from art packing and handling materials.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Catvalon is both an imaginary space and a real place.  Participants have been invited to visit and document SMMS inside of his enclosure (#catcamp).  On the outside, a cat themed art show will decorate the rest of helper (renamed @helpurr for the exhibition).  The entrance to Catvalon will be sealed at the opening.  The majority of viewers will only experience the enchanted mists of Catvalon through the internet,  i.e. via remote viewing.  In Arthurian fashion, Catvalon is a space only available to initiates.  At the opening all webfeeds will go down, making sure that neither the real nor imaginary public will know whether the cat is alive or dead.  </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the rules of #catcamp are thus defined:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">//Rule1: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c8">#catcamp</span><span class="c0"> </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">//During the festival of July 7th the doors to Catvalon will be sealed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">    </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">//Rule2: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">#truthtomeowterials</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">//Materials should not be camouflaged.
